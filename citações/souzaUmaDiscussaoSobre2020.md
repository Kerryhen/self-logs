> A historical narrative is presented that represents a snapshot of the theoretical frameworks that occupy a central place in the quantum debate and that gave rise to several interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (QM). Initially, we discussed the argument of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (1935) and the later developments focusing on the work of John Bell (1964), which returned the questions of theoretical foundation to the field, also, experimental. Facing the argument that was most important in the search for an interpretation of QM, in accordance with the period, we highlight the Copenhagen Interpretation and its coherence with nature with quantum phenomena. This historical narrative is supported by the theoretical and methodological requirements of the new historiography of the history of science. We use original texts as primary sources and several other secondary ones that run around the EPR argument. A possible contribution of this article is the use by students / professors of physics and enthusiasts of quantum theory, considering that, despite the importance of the discussions on the maintenance of determinism, realism and non-locality, almost all textbooks aimed at QM learning, with rare exceptions, ignores relevant aspects in consequence, it somehow fills gaps regarding the lack of teaching materials.
